# GettingCleaningData
##Code Book
###This document describes the code inside run_analysis.R.  

###The code has 6 steps (by comments):

* Initial setup (load libraries, set working directory)
* Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* Step 6: export tidy data to text file
